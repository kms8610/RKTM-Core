  <!-- EN: A loose confederation of pirate groups who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nPirates don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range.\n\nThis particular gang of pirates are cannibals. -->

  <TribeCannibal.description>이 곳에서 아주 오랜 시간동안 살아온 사람들입니다. 이들의 조상은 수천년 전 이 곳에 불시착했을지도 모릅니다. 또는 이전에 존재하던 문명 사회를 파괴한 재앙에서 살아남은 것일 수도 있습니다. 어떤 경우든, 부족들은 대부분 유목민으로 이루어졌으며 오직 원시적인 도구와 무기만을 사용합니다.\n\n이들의 기술적 약점에도 불구하고 저수준의 기술을 이용한 전쟁기술, 많은 무릿수, 그리고 용기는 이들을 위험한 적으로 만들 수도 있습니다.\n\n특히 이 잔혹한 부족은 적군의 고기를 먹는 것이 큰 영광이라고 믿습니다.</TribeCannibal.description>
